# Mochi Lab
Git repository for my studies in web-development  😸
## About
I made an app using VS-Code as IDE and Vue3 as front-end framework.
It does not have a back-end structure because I'm still early on learning, but the app does store locally using [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) module.
## Deploy
This is deployed in [mochilab.netlify.app](https://mochilab.netlify.app/ )
